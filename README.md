## Introduction
Welcome to Project 2024: HY360. This project is designed to provide a simple solution for managing and analyzing data efficiently.

## HOW_TO_RUN
The project was created as a Maven project in Intellij Ultimate
It uses a Tomcat server to interact with the data base + the exploded version of the artifact of the project file.
(Use either Tomcat 9 or Tomcat 10  by changing the imports for the servlets to 'javax' or 'jakarta' respectively)
